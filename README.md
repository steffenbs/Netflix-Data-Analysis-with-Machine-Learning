# Netflix catalogue
Keeping customers on your video on demand platform is essential to keep the company
from going bankrupt. One way of retaining customers is to make accurate predictions of
what content a user should be recommended based on their watch history or popular and
trending content.
In this project you are given a dataset consisting of many movies and TV shows from the
Netflix catalogue. The goal is to attempt to gain an overview of the dataset, as well as
uncovering interesting relationships between the features.
In summary, the contributions to this work are listed below:
1. Handle any null values in the dataset.
2. Visualize the data. Is it possible to see some defining features of each genre?
3. Analyze how Netflixâ€™s catalogue has evolved over the years. Have they moved
more towards series or movies? How has the number of entries for each category
changed? There are many such questions that you may want to answer.
4. Try to predict the genre of a movie/show based on the director, actors, etc. using
machine/deep learning techniques.
5. Evaluate your results using relevant metrics, such as precision and recall.
6. (Advanced) Use the description/title columns to predict the genre of a
movie/show.
